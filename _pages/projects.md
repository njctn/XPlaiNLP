# NEWS-POLYGRAPH

<div style="text-align: justify">
Deliberately placed misinformation and media manipulation have become a widespread phenomenon, especially in social media. They are increasingly realistic and credible and are used to deliberately mislead in almost all socially relevant areas. The RUBIN alliance NEWS-POLYGRAPH strengthens the media industry by simplifying the verification processes of media content with the help of artificial intelligence (AI).

## Project description

<div style="text-align: justify">
The aim of the NEWS-POLYGRAPH alliance is to develop suitable solutions for use in the media industry, enabling early detection of fake content or false information. To this end, an interactive platform is being developed to support the various verification tasks of journalists. To facilitate and assist the work of journalists, AI tools are being developed that analyze texts, images, audio files and videos for various characteristics that indicate mis- and disinformation. Criteria for transparency, explainability of the AI tools and the prevention of bias will play an important role in making the AI tools reliable and comprehensible. In addition, processes are being developed to integrate crowdworkers into the fake news detection process, who can analyze media content in addition to the AI tools. 

Overall, an AI-based platform is being developed that supports journalists and media professionals in detecting false information in an intuitive, transparent and, above all, time-saving manner.
