abstract: 'Nowadays, smartphones are equipped with various sensors collecting a huge amount of sensitive personal information about their users. However, for smartphone users, it remains hidden, and sensitive information is accessed by used applications and data requestors. Moreover, governmental institutions have no means to verify if applications requesting sensitive information are compliant with the General Data Protection Directive (GDPR), as it is infeasible to check the technical details and data requested by applications that are on the market. Thus, this research aims to shed light on the compliance analysis of applications with the GDPR. Therefore, a multidimensional analysis is applied to analyzing the permission requests of applications. The use case of security camera applications was chosen, as they access highly sensitive personal information. Our results confirm that these apps suffer from serious privacy issues ranging from regulatory compliance issues to inappropriate design and development strategies that can severely impact users’ privacy.'
