abstract: 'Privacy can be approached from different perspectives. Within this research, the cognate-based definition of privacy is examined with respect to the influence of elemental traits of individuals, such as hungriness. Hungriness is examined in relation to privacy constructs, namely, privacy concern, privacy literacy, and trust and risk beliefs. This research investigates whether the sensation of hunger and an individual’s varying metabolic states influence our perception of privacy.  Moreover, this research contributes to the ongoing debate in privacy studies by empirically examining whether privacy should be regarded as a state or a trait. A crowdsourcing study was conducted with 336 participants to examine the effects and associations between hungriness and the participant’s privacy perception. The results from the analysis show that hungriness does not affect privacy constructs, such as privacy concern and risk and trust beliefs, but has an effect on privacy literacy by significantly decreasing privacy literacy when being in the metabolic state called fed state (0-5 hours after having eaten). Overall, the results support the cognate-based definition of privacy, which suggests that privacy is more appropriately characterized as a trait rather than a transient state.'
